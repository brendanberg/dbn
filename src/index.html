					<h2>The DBN Environment</h2>

					<p>Draw By Numeral is a programming environment and language designed

					immediate feedback through a simple graphics rendering context.</p>

					<p>The DBN environment presents a code editor and graphical output
					side-by-side in a single window. The features of the environment are
					described below.</p>

					<h2>The DBN Language</h2>

					<p>The DBN language is designed to be easy for beginners.
					The language intentonally leaves out many features that are
					common in general-purpouse languages such as Python or JavaScript.
					By limiting the features of DBN, we can spend less time
					learning the complexities of a general-purpose language and
					more time learning broader concepts of computer programming.</p>

					<p>A DBN program's output is a virtual sheet of paper. The
					paper is divided into a grid of 101 &times; 101 squares,
					each of which can be filled with a shade of gray. The
					language </p>

					<h3>Making a Statement</h3>

					<p>The simplest DBN program consists of a single statement:</p>

					<table>
						<tr>
<td><img src='/assets/examples/statements_0.png' class='example' width='101' height='101'></td>
<td><pre>Paper 0</pre></td>
						</tr>
					</table>

					<p>This statement tells DBN to color the entire paper white.
					Taking a closer look at the statement, we see it consists of
					a command name (<code>Paper</code>), followed by a space, and
					then a number that tells DBN how light or dark the paper
					should be. We call this numerical value an <em>argument</em>.</p>
					
					<p class="aside">Grayscale values in DBN are represented as
					numbers from 0 (white) to 100 (black).</p>

					<p>Let's look at a more complex example. The following
					DBN program draws a single line from the lower left to the
					upper right of the paper.</p>

					<table>
						<tr>
<td><img src='/assets/examples/statements_1.png' class='example' width='101' height='101'></td>
<td><pre>Paper 0
Pen 100
Line 0 0 100 100</pre></td>
						</tr>
					</table>

					<p>This program consists of three statements, each on its
					own line. In DBN, only one statement may be written per
					line, and statements cannot span multiple lines.</p>
					
					<p>Looking at the second line, we see a new command,
					<code>Pen</code>, which takes one argument. Like
					the <code>Paper</code> command, the argument represents
					the desired grayscale value. The <code>Line</code> command
					expects four arguments, which must be separated by spaces.</p>

					<p>The arguments to the <code>Line</code> command tell it
					the x and y coordinates of the two points that will be
					connected by a line. In this example, the program draws a
					line from <nobr>(0, 0)</nobr> to <nobr>(100, 100)</nobr>.
					The order of the arguments to the command is important:
					the first two arguments represent the x and y coordinates of
					the first point, and the last two arguments represent the
					coordinates of the second point.</p>

					<h3>Variables</h3>

					<p>A <em>variable</em> is a placeholder for a numeric value.
					Anywhere a number is used, a variable may be used in its place.</p>

					<p>We can give the variable a value using the <code>Set</code>
					command. <code>Set</code> expects two arguments: the first
					argument is the name we will use to refer to the variable
					and the second argument is the value that will be assigned
					to the variable.</p>

<pre>Set X 50</pre>

					<p>In the previvous statement, the variable called <code>X</code>
					gets the value 50. We can refer to <code>X</code> elsewhere
					in our program by its name, as in the following <code>Line</code>
					command:</p>

<pre>Line 20 X 80 X</pre>

					<p>Since the variable <code>X</code> was previously given
					the value 50, the program will draw a line from <nobr>(20, 50)</nobr>
					to <nobr>(80, 50).</nobr></p>

					<h3>Calculations</h3>

					<p>Expressions are mathematical calculations enclosed in parentheses.</p>

<pre>Paper (100 - 50)</pre>

					<p>Parentheses may also be used to force a different order
					of operations. DBN will compute multiplication and division
					before addition and subtraction (just like how we learned
					to do arithmetic in school). If we want to perform addition
					before multiplication, just enclose the addition in parentheses
					like this: <code>((10 + 1) * 50)</code>.</p>

					<h3>Repeating Yourself</h3>

					<p>Loops are a way to perform a sequence of statements
					repeatedly. We could perform a command multiple times by typing it in
					repeatedly, but as you can see in the following example, it
					quickly becomes tedious to type.</p>

					<table>
						<tr>
<td><img src='/assets/examples/looping_0.png' class='example' width='101' height='101'></td>
<td><pre>Paper 0
Pen 70
Line 0 40 100 40
Line 0 60 100 60
Line 0 70 100 70
Line 0 75 100 75
Line 0 78 100 78
Line 0 80 100 80
</pre></td>
						</tr>
					</table>

					<p>To make it easier to perform repetition in your programs,
					DBN provides commands to repeat a sequence of statements
					multiple times. <code>Repeat</code> is one such command.</p>

					<p>A <code>Repeat</code> statement expects a variable name 
					that will hold the current iteration count, a value from
					which to start counting, and a value to count until. The
					<code>Repeat</code> statement must be followed by a
					sequence of statements enclosed in braces (called a
					<em>block</em>.)</p>

					<p>Inside the block, we can refer to the variable and use
					it as a value to the repeated statements. This lets us
					repeat ourselves while changing what we say slightly each time</p>

					<table>
						<tr>
<td><img src='/assets/examples/looping_1.png' class='example' width='101' height='101'></td>
<td><pre>Paper 0
Repeat X 0 100
{
    Pen X
    Line X 0 X 100
}</pre></td>
						</tr>
					</table>

					<p>In the preceding example, the <code>Repeat</code>
					statement begins by giving <code>X</code> the value 0. It then executes
					the statements in the block and increments the value of <code>X</code>
					by one before repeating. Once the value of <code>X</code> exceeds 100,
					the repetition stops and execution continues with the rest
					of the program.</p>

					<p class="aside">Loops don't always have to count up! If
					the <code>Repeat</code> statement's end value is
					<em>less than</em> the start value, the iteration count will
					<em>decrement</em> by 1 after each execution of the loop body.</p>

					<h3>Asking Questions</h3>

					<p>Occasionally we would like to be able to run a sequence
					of statements only when certain conditions are true. DBN
					provides four comparison commands that test whether the
					two provided values have a particular relation, and execute
					the block directly below them only when the desired relation
					holds.</p>

					<p>Consider this program:</p>

					<table>
						<tr>
<td><img src='/assets/examples/conditions_0.png' class='example' width='101' height='101'></td>
<td><pre>Paper 0
Pen 100
Set A 20
Smaller? A 50
{
    Line A A 50 50
}</pre></td>
						</tr>
					</table>

					<p>The <code>Smaller?</code> command tests whether the first
					argument is less than the second, and since the value in
					the variable <code>A</code> is less than 50, the test passes
					and the program executes the block with the <code>Line</code>
					command. If we were to edit the program so the value of
					<code>A</code> were 80, the test would fail and no line
					would be drawn.</p>

					<p>The three other comparison commands are <code>NotSmaller?</code>,
					which tests whether the first argument is larger than or
					the same as the second argument; <code>Same?</code> which
					tests whether the two arguments are equal; and
					<code>NotSame?</code>, which tests whether the two arguments
					are different.</p>
					
					<p>Comparisons are frequently helpful when writing loops.
					If we want to execute certain commands only when the
					iteration count is within a desired range, we can use
					a comparison statement inside the loop body</p>

					<table>
						<tr>
<td><img src='/assets/examples/conditions_1.png' class='example' width='101' height='101'></td>
<td><pre>Repeat X 0 100
{
    Pen X
    Smaller? X 50
    {
        Line 0 X 100 X
    }
}</pre></td>
						</tr>
					</table>

					<p>As we repeat from 0 to 100, we test the value of <code>X</code>
					each time through the loop, and only draw a line if <code>X</code>
					is less than 50.</p>

					<h3>Defining Commands</h3>

					<p>We can define our own commands with the <code>Command</code>
					command.</p>

					<table>
						<tr>
<td><img src='/assets/examples/commands_0.png' class='example' width='101' height='101'></td>
<td><pre>Paper 0
Pen 100
Command Rectangle x0 y0 x1 y1
{
    Line x0 y0 x1 y0
    Line x0 y0 x0 y1
    Line x0 y1 x1 y1
    Line x1 y0 x1 y1
}
Rectangle 30 30 70 70
</pre></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
